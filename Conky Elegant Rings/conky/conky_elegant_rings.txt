conky_elegant_rings.lua script explantaion
by Dean Loros 10/20/2013

Different systems will need different settings for pixel distance...you will need to play with with the "y=" pixel distances to align rings with text..
Try to NOT change the "x=" settings--this will change location in the background image.

Of course, #'d out segments will not show & will require text re-alignment.
This Conky works great on my system--I'm sure you will need to re-adjust to make it look/work well with yours.....  Of course, we all know that is half of the fun :)

Clock Ring configure  
by Abu Yahya v1.0 05/06/12

Following parameters are essential otherwise will output as nil value
name='', (as parsed by conky) 
arg='', (parsed by conky so may allow balank if not try '/)'
max_value='',  (maximum value for the parameter
x='', the horizontal position for radius of cups saurcers and graduations
y='', vertical posisiotn for radius

The rest of the paramaters have default values if not specifically stated.
------------------------------------
The script allows 3 components 

1. typical clock hands or radial gauge indicators - called handle

2. a base circular graph having a fixed background and fixed starting  point foreground and end point is the (string) value - called cups   

3. connected thick and thin rings that do not have a fixed starting point but move as a funtion of the value. inaddition the thick rings circumference is also increases with the (string) value. called thick and thin saucers. note the thin sauuceris 1 pixel thick and overlaps either the inner or outer circumfence of the thick saucer. 

------------------------------------
Non-essential parameters

cup_radius is the radial distance to the center of the cup wall and the center of the handle. by default this is a quarter of the conky window width.

cup_start_angle is the angular position from which the 0 string value is based and relative to the upward position, can range from 0 - 360. default is 0 which is set to the upward position.  

total_angle is the angle from the cup_start_angle that the cup (graph should end at. for a full circle this is 360 and for a semicircle it is 180. for clockwise motion it is a positive vlaue and for anticlockwise motion it is a negative value (e.g. -360). default is 360.    

cup_wall_thickness is the distance starting from the cup_radius and extending simultanously both away and towards the radius and defines the radial thickness of the base circular graph background or cup wall. default is 20.

handle_length is the distance from the cup-radius and extends simultanously both towards and away from the radius. if set the same as cup_wall_thickness then will be confined within the cup (graph) arc. if set to the double the cup_radius will originate from x,y centre point. default is 20.

handle_circ is the circumferential distance (or thickness) of the handle at the handle starting point i.e. the cup_radius.

saucer_radius is the distance from x,y to the saucer's inner  circumference. default is half of conky window width.

total_saucer_angle is the angle from the cup_start_angle that the cup (graph should end at. for a full circle this is 360 and for a semicircle it is 180. direction of motion is determined by total_angle. acceptable range is 0 - 360. default is 360.  

saucer_thickness is the radial distance of the thick saucer. default is 6. note the thin saucer is set to 1 pixel thickness to prevent displaying it but allowing the thick saucer set thin_saucer_circ to 0 see later.

thick_saucer_circ is the relative circumferential distance of the total_saucer_angle when the string value reaches the max_value. if total_saucer_angle is set to 360 (i.e full circle) then thick_saucer_circ would need to be 1.0 for a full circle. Default is 0.9 which gives a 90% circle with 10% incomplete centered at the saucer mark (providing total_saucer_angle is 360).

thin_saucer_circ is the relative circumferential distance of the total_saucer_angle as described above. its circumferential distance is defined  and does not change relative to the string value like thick_saucer_circ. its radial thickness is restricted to 1 pixel and overlaps the inner or outer circumfence of thick_saucer_circ. the two saucers move together. default is 0.9.

inner_saucer determines the position of the thick_saucer relative to the thin saucer. set to true then the thick saucer is on the inner aspect of the thin saucer. default is false (nil).

(saucer mark is the string value  whose radial distance is dependent upon saucer_thickness while its circumfential distance is dependent upon handle_circ ). its position is at the string value but relative to the saucer is dependent upon 

graduation_radius is the radial distance from x,y fo the position of the graduation marks. graduation marks are within the total_angle and follow its clockwise or anticlockwise direction from the cup_start_angle. default is a third of conky window width.

graduation_thickness is the radial distance of each graduation mark. default is 2.

graduation_mark_circ is the circumferential distance of each graduation mark. default is 1.

graduation_mark_angle is the angular measurement between on graduation mark and the next.  default is total_angle/10 giving 10 graduation marks. (for a hourly clock gradutation you would set it at 30 (degrees) [=360/12] )
  
 
xtxt is the position of any desired text relative to centre, x. negative number would move left and positive number move right. default is 0 (i.e at  x )

ytxt is the position of any desired text relative to centre, y. negative number would move up and positive number move down. default is 0 (i.e at  y )

caption= 'add text here ',   
returns the above text (e.g. add text here) before the string value. can include spaces. default is blank.

caption2= 'add text here ',   
returns the above text (e.g. add text here) after the string value. can include spaces. useful for units e.g %.  default is blank.

...._clr is the hex value representation of colours default is 0xffffff (white)

....._alpha is the degree of visibility ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.  ).0 is invisible and 1.0 is opaque and graded levels of transparency between the two (0.1 - 0.9). defaults are set to 0.  THIS IS IMPORTANT to change if you wish to make something visible.

fg refers to foreground
bg refers to background 
if undiffined then foreground is intented. 

cup_sector_angle and cup_sector_circ are both obselete parameters

Hopefully most of it was covered.
